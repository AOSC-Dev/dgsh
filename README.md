## The Scatter Gather Shell (SGSH)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dspinellis/sgsh.svg?branch=NG)](https://travis-ci.org/dspinellis/sgsh)

The scatter gather shell, *sgsh*, allows the expressive expression of efficient big data set and streams processing pipelines using existing Unix tools as well as custom-built components. It is a Unix-style shell allowing the specification of pipelines with non-linear scatter-gather operations. These form a directed acyclic process graph, which is typically executed by multiple processor cores, thus increasing the operation's processing throughput.

You can find a complete introduction, reference documentation,
and illustrated examples in the suite's

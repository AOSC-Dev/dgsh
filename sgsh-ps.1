.SH NAME
sgsh-ps \- report process status in JSON format
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsgsh-ps\fP \fIprocess-id\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIsgsh-ps\fP will report the status of each child of
the process specified by \fIprocess-id\fP in JSON format.
The results are printed on the standard output as an array
containing an entry for each process.
Each entry is a collection of key-value pairs.
The key is a metric (e.g. user time) and the value is a human-readable
rendering of the corresponding measurement (e.g. 452KiB).
The precise number, wording, and format of the supported values depends on the
underlying operating system.
All systems will provide at least one entry, named \fICOMMAND\fP,
which contains the command name and arguments associated with a given process.
.PP
The command is used internally by \fIsgsh\fP for the debugging user interface.

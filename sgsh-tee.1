.SH NAME
sgsh-tee \- buffer and copy or scatter standard input to one or more sinks
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsgsh-tee\fP
[\fB\-b\fP \fIbuffer-size\fP]
[\fB\-ims\fP]
[\fB\-S\fP \fImemory-size\fP]
[\fB\-t\fP \fIcharacter\fP]
[\fIfile ...\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIsgsh-tee\fP will read data from its standard input and scatter it to
the specified sinks as files.
It resembles in its operation \fItee\fP(1),
but offers additional capabilities required for the operation of \fIsgsh\fP(1).
In contrast to \fItee\fP(1), \fIsgsh-tee\fP will buffer the data it handles,
so it will never cause deadlock or starvation when one or more sinks
are unable to read data.
.PP
\fIsgsh-tee\fP is normally executed from within \fIsgsh\fP-generated scripts,
rather than through end-user commands.
This manual page serves mainly to document its operation,
to clarify the flags that can be used at the beginning of an \fIsgsh\fP scatter block, and
to allow the creation of plug-compatible replacements
implementing different record types.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-b\fP \fIbuffer-size\fP"
Specify the size of the buffer to use.
This is by default 1MB.
Buffers are chained together when more space is required,
so the main utility of this option is to decrease the buffer
size in memory-constrained environments.
The specified number can be suffixed with
\fBk\fI, \fBM\fI, or \fBG\fI to specify the corresponding unit.
The specified buffer size must be less than the program's maximum memory size.

.IP "\fB\-i\fP"
Implement input-side buffering.
By default \fIsgsh-tee\fP will buffer only as much input data,
as is needed to avoid starving one of the specified sinks.
In doing so it may cause its input source to block
while having data to write.
When this option is enabled
\fIsgsh-tee\fP will always read data if they are available
on the standard input,
and will write that data to any (including zero) sinks that
can read it.
This can be useful in cases where a command with insufficient input
buffering,
like \fIjoin\fP(1), \fIsort\fP(1), or \fIpaste\fP(1),
is gathering input from commands executing in parallel.
In such a case adding \fIsgsh-tee\fP with input side buffering
enabled at the end of each data pipeline,
will increase the number of processes that can operate concurrently.

.IP "\fB\-m\fP"
Provide memory use statistics on termination.
This is mainly used for testing,
to check against leaks of buffers.

.IP "\fB\-S\fP \fImemory-size\fP"
Specify the maximum size of memory to allocate for buffers.
This is by default 256MB.
When \fIsgsh-tee\fP exhausts this memory, it sleeps for one second
to let its output buffers drain, and then tries again to allocate the
required memory.
The specified number can be suffixed with
\fBk\fI, \fBM\fI, or \fBG\fI to specify the corresponding unit.
The specified maximum memory size must be larger than the program's buffer size.

.IP "\fB\-s\fP"
Scatter the input fairly across the sinks, rather than copying it to all.
When this option is in effect,
the input data are divided into chunks of one or more lines,
and each chunk is written only to a single sink.
This is useful for dividing the work among multiple processes operating
in parallel.

.IP "\fB\-t\fP \fIchar\fP"
Use \fIchar\fP as the record separator,
By default the record separator is a newline,
An empty (not missing) argument for the record separator
will make the record separator be the null character.
